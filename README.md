# Overview

This repository has all LaMEM input files and MATLAB scripts needed to reproduce Figures 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11.  Visit each figure folder for instructions. 

# 

# Software

The 3D numerical models were produced using the using the open source geodynamics software LaMEM (Lithosphere and Mantle Evolution Model, https://github.com/UniMainzGeo/LaMEM), version 2.2.0, provided here as well as on Zenodo (https://zendo.org/XYZ to be created upon manuscript acceptance for publication).  The MATLAB codes produced the 2D elastic models and are included.
