First run "stress_analyze_cell_multiplemods.m" to compute statistics.  Note
that the paths of the various folders are given in the file so the user will
need to change those appropriately to point to the location of the model
output

Fig8_vary_wTF.m produce panels a-c
Fig8_vary_wTF_stress_profiles produce panels d-e.

LaMEM input files: These are used to produce the model output ready by the 
above MATLAB scripts. Filename convention:
T30Nuk2Weak75.dat
Transform length=30, Nussult number Nu=2, Friction on TF and FZ multiplied
by 0.75. (Magma pressure width is 1000 km for all).
